I'm **Luke Dunshea**. Most days I'm building things with codegen, researching [Kaspa](https://x.com/search?f=user&q=kaspa&src=typed_query), or learning something new.

I work on a mix of personal projects — usually involving AI-assisted development and crypto. Currently deep in the Kaspa ecosystem, working on related projects and following the tech closely.

This site is where I share what I'm working on and thinking about.
